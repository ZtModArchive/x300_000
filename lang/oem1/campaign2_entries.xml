                  A group of African elephants was scheduled to be culled in the Kingdom of Sironjia due to elephant overpopulation. Instead, they have been offered to the zoo that creates the best and most suitable habitat for the animals. One crated African elephant has been delivered to your zoo and can be found         near the front gate.

                  Create a wildlife exhibit for the elephant and ensure that its basic needs are met.         If you can demonstrate your ability to care for this species, you will be given three more animals of mixed gender to help you establish a thriving community.

      <elephantpart1successoverview>         The Kingdom of Sironjia is pleased to be able to offer you the remaining African elephants. The animals will be delivered to your zoo shortly. The habitat conditions will be monitored by the International Society of Animal Wellbeing (ISAW) for the next 3 months. Should you fail to meet the basic needs for any of these animals, they will be removed from your zoo and donated to another facility.</elephantpart1successoverview>

                  An unnamed zoo in North America has been operating in an unregulated and          uncontrolled environment. A series of animal abuse complaints brought against          the facility have initiated an official investigation. The animals were found          in poorly designed and poorly maintained facilities that did not provide for their  health and psychological well-being. These mistreated animals need          rehabilitative care.

                  Although your facility has so far only catered to small animals, you are one of the few in the area with vacant land. Due to the emergency nature of the situation, yours is the only facility capable of accommodating these animals.

      <SmugglingRingoverview>         Authorities have exposed an international smuggling ring that was illegally trading          endangered animals. Many animals have been recovered in recent raids and are          desperate for suitable homes. You have been given the opportunity to obtain several          endangered animals if you can quickly prepare exhibits that will house them          successfully. You will receive a new crated animal near the front gate at a regular interval for as          long as you can maintain the happiness and welfare of the animals you have previously          received. Further shipments of animals will cease on first report that any animal          previously sent to your facility does not have its environment needs adequately met. You must make sure to          provide the animal with enough space in an exhibit area of the correct biome. </SmugglingRingoverview>

      <SmugglingRingPart2overview>        The animals you received were confiscated from a smuggling operation and had         likely been poached from game reserves. Many of them may have been separated from their         mothers while very young. It would be an incredible accomplishment to be able to return         these animals to the wild. A cooperative group has donated additional animals to your facility so that         your animals will have social companions. Meet the advanced needs of the animals so that you may release one animal from        each species back into their natural habitats.     </SmugglingRingPart2overview>

      <SmugglingRingPart2Successoverview>Congratulations!  You have successfully returned one of each species rescued from an international smuggling ring to their natural habitats, and your efforts are lauded by animal conservationists worldwide.
