           A prominent zoo would like to open a new sister facility to display an exhibit area featuring three different species of   animals from North America. However, due to foreign content restrictions established by the ruling government, these   species must represent less than 30% of the species on exhibit.
         
         
         
         <p/>
         
         
         
         To include three species from North America in your zoo and be within the regulations, you must have at least eight different species that are from regions other than North America.

           The Board of Directors of your zoo has mandated that four Asian species be obtained within one   year. Unfortunately, animals from Asia are in short supply! Zoos around the world have had difficulty obtaining   these treasured endangered animals, and they are only being offered to zoos with the highest of reputations. 
         
         
         
         <p/>
         
         
         
         You have one year to obtain the animals. Given their scarcity, you'll need to achieve zoo fame of  four stars to even hope to obtain enough of these rare creatures.

      <AsianAnimalsoverviewshort>  The Board of Directors of your zoo has mandated that the four Asian species be obtained within one year. Unfortunately, animals from Asia are in short supply! Do what it takes to increase your zoo's reputation so that you can acquire these rare creatures. Complete all scenarios in this campaign to unlock the globe statue!      </AsianAnimalsoverviewshort>
      <AsianAnimalsSuccessoverview>The addition of these rare Asian animals has had the expected positive impact on zoo attendance. Your zoo is thriving, and the Board is exceptionally pleased with your results. In recognition of your accomplishment, you have been given the globe statue, which you will be able to use in all of your future endeavors.     </AsianAnimalsSuccessoverview>
      <AsianAnimalsFailureoverview>Unfortunately, the mandated time allowed by your Board of Directors has expired. Regrettably they have had to find an alternate direction for the zoo.      </AsianAnimalsFailureoverview>

           A wealthy landowner in Northern Europe wants to attempt the impossible. He has a vacant plot of land and would   like to create an animal park featuring animals only from Africa. He has provided enough funding to get started,   and will pay out some additional cash each time a new African animal species is added. The completed park must hold   12 different species of animals that originate in Africa.
         
         
         
         <p/>
         
         
         
         In the interest of getting the park off the ground, he's willing to accept that it may be necessary to include animals from other regions of the world. Ultimately, however, for the park to meet his criteria, the park must be home to animals only from Africa. Any animals from other regions must be released to the wild for the park to be considered complete.

           Guests particularly enjoy exhibits that resemble the natural habitat of the animals they house. They are even   more impressed when an entire ecosystem can be modeled within such an exhibit. Create a savannah exhibit   that contains both herbivores and carnivores. Ensure that their environment needs are met. As long as your   carnivores' food needs are being met by your zookeepers, your herbivores should be safe. To make the   exhibit a success, you will need at least six herbivores and four carnivores within the same area. 
         
      
         
         <p/>
         
         
         
           Continue to run this exhibit for four months. As long as you maintain this exhibit, you will   receive an additional $2,000 per month in grant funding to help pay the staff cost likely required to keep this running smoothly.

      <HugeBiomeSuccessoverview>Your ecosystem has been successful over the four month trial period. Guests enjoyed the exhibit immensely in spite of the additional stress on zoo staff to keep the carnivores sated!      </HugeBiomeSuccessoverview>
      <HugeBiomeFailureoverview>Your ecosystem exhibit has failed as you were unable to prevent your carnivores from attacking your herbivores. You have lost all funding for this program.     </HugeBiomeFailureoverview>
      <HugeBiomeFailureWitnessedoverview>Your zoo has suffered a serious setback when one of your guests witnessed one of your animals become prey to another. Your biome exhibit is considered a failure and parents are outraged that their children were exposed to the brutality of a live animal becoming prey to another. Regrettably your zoo has had to put a significant sum of money into escrow to pay the legal fees expected as a result of the lawsuit filed on behalf of the Outraged Parents Coalition.       </HugeBiomeFailureWitnessedoverview>

           A biome is characterized by the plant and animal life and climate in a region. The Earth has many different   environments that vary in temperature, moisture, light, and the life that the various conditions support.

         The geography department of a major university has funded a massive biome project to create a facility where the major biomes of the world are represented and can be used for study, research and education. By creating such an environment and opening it to the public, it is hoped that the benefits of education can be shared at the same time that some of the costs of the project are defrayed by public admission.

         Create a single zoo that features each of the following biomes and ensure that you have at least one animal in each exhibit.
