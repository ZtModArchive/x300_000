         Your local city council and animal welfare society want to run a "Free Admission" promotion at your zoo for community residents. They hope to deliver the message that proper        care and feeding is essential to all animals, and that domestic animals deserve the same attention        as the exotic animals in your zoo. They have agreed to pay you an upfront fee of $2,500. This        promotion will last for up to one month as long as your animals remain healthy. At the        end of the promotion period, if no animals became ill, you will receive an additional $2,500 and additional compensation for your lost admissions fees. If an animal becomes ill, the promotion will end        immediately. You'll receive no further compensation and the animal will be removed from your facility.

      <CHgrantmoneySuccess>       The promotion period has ended and the animals in your facility have been receiving excellent care. City council considers the promotion a resounding success and have reimbursed you for the lost admissions during       the promotional period.      </CHgrantmoneySuccess>
      <CHgrantmoneySuccessShort>       The promotion was a success! You've received an additional $2,500 and have been reimbursed for lost admissions!       </CHgrantmoneySuccessShort>
      <CHgrantmoneyFailure>Unfortunately your %s has become ill. City council does not feel that this is the message they wish to deliver and have cancelled the promotion. Your admission prices will return to normal, and you will not receive any additional funds for lost admissions. Also, the sick animal has been confiscated and sent to an alternate facility.      </CHgrantmoneyFailure>
      <CHgrantmoneyFailureShort>You have failed to maintain healthy animals. The promotion is now over and your %s has been sent to another facility due to illness.</CHgrantmoneyFailureShort>

                                            Bear biologists from around the world are looking for a venue where they can hold a conference to share the latest research and management information about bears. They have agreed to hold their conference at your site and pay you a $2,000 site fee as long as you can add another species of Ursidae to your facility.

                              The Zoological Cooperative Association (ZCA) is running a feasibility study to determine if member zoos can benefit from a program of trading species between zoos. As a member, you will exchange one of your species for a new species for a temporary one-month period. It is essential that you keep the new species healthy and achieve a donation income of $500 for your new species over this period. Otherwise, the venture will be financially unsuccessful. The study will determine if a regularly rotating exhibit cycle has a positive impact on zoo attendance and cash flow. If the venture proves to be a success, you will receive $2,500 for your efforts, and you will be able to keep the new animals.

At the end of this trial period, your original species will be returned to your zoo.

      <CHAnimalTradeRevealed>The ZCA has removed each %s from your zoo as per the terms of the study. Your new species, the %s, has been delivered crated to the area near your front gate. You have one month to earn $500 in guest donations for this new species.   </CHAnimalTradeRevealed>

      <CHAnimalTradeFailureShort>Unfortunately you failed to generate enough cash to indicate that species swapping is viable. The study has been cancelled and the loaned animals have been removed.</CHAnimalTradeFailureShort>
      <CHAnimalTradeFirstSuccess>The ZCA has completed their study on the benefits of trading species among member zoos. Your results appear to be very positive and the Association will consider making this a regular benefit available to zoo members. You have been given a cash grant of $2,500, and you get to keep the new animals.</CHAnimalTradeFirstSuccess>
      <CHAnimalTradeFailure>Unfortunately this exhibit swap has proven to be financially unattractive. Without donations of $500, the cost to transport the species exceeds the results obtained. The ZCA has cancelled the study and removed the animals on loan.</CHAnimalTradeFailure>

Pending the satisfactory negotiation of a new contract, your maintenance workers have walked off the job. It is expected that the strike action could last one month. You can pay a high-priced strike team $4,000 to handle trash cleanup until your maintenance workers return. Or, you can choose not to pay their fee and collect and clean the trash in your zoo yourself to avoid unhappy guests.

If you argue their claim, your zoo will be closed to the public for one month while they re-inspect the facility for ill or unhappy animals. If you do argue the claim and the animals are again found in poor condition at the end of the month, you will pay a $2500 fine.

                                            The Residential Family Society has begun a campaign promoting the benefits of enrichment and stimulation for pre-school children and is making the correlation that captive animals also benefit from enrichment and stimulation in their lives. They have issued a challenge to zoos nationwide to provide their animals with ample enrichment objects and have imposed a one-month deadline.

                                            Since your zoo is local to their headquarters, they have targeted your facility for extensive publicity. You will need to research six new enrichment objects and use them in your exhibits to demonstrate your commitment to animal enrichment.

Should you fail to uphold their ideal they will be merciless in their criticism and you will likely see your attendance decrease.
